weather event counter (changeme)

## Initial Setup
Before running, `openpyxl` must be installed using `pip`. To do so, navigate to the folder containing the python files within the command line and enter the following command:

```virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt```

The script must be run one time to set itself up before it can be used. To do so, navigate to the folder containing the python files and run the main script with the command:

```python event_counter.py``` or ```python3 event_counter.py``` if multiple versions of Python are installed.

This first run will generate the following folders: `data`, `events`, `logs`, and `output`
